## Release Note - Progress 2 of Chesskid Connect

### What's New In This Version

#### 1. Enhanced Data Query and Confirmation

- **New Data Query**: We've improved ChessKid Connect by adding the ability to query user data in the database based on chess level and game platform. Now, users can view and confirm data entries that match specific criteria, making it easier to find and connect with chess enthusiasts who share similar interests.

- **Match Result Confirmation**: Introducing a new "Confirmation Page" feature! After querying and finding data that matches your criteria, you can now confirm specific entries. This helps you acknowledge and establish connections with chess players who closely match your preferences.

- **Ordered by Kid Age**: Search results are now ordered by the closest kid age, ensuring that you see potential chess partners with age proximity.

- **isNewData Flag**: To make the experience even better, we've introduced a "new data" flag. This flag ensures that recently submitted data won't interfere with your search results. You'll only see data that's relevant to your query, excluding any information from the current session.
